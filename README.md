## Tweet Sentiment Classifier

Your task is to build, train and evaluate a simple sentiment analysis classifier in Python.

You can use any packages or techniques you wish, but you should discuss and show your working at all times.

Free to use the internet, but any copy-pasted code should be clearly explained, and may result in less credit.

Relax, and feel free to ask questions.

Donâ€™t worry about doing everything that occurs to you - you will have a chance at the end to discuss what you would do with unlimited time.
 
Take some time now to initialise an environment, and loosely plan your strategy with me.
 
Suggested environment:
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`
- `pandas`
